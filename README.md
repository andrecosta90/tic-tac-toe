# tic-tac-toe

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Ruby.

## How to Run

To play the game, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. Then, navigate to the directory containing the `game.rb` file and run the following command:

```bash
ruby game.rb
```

## How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.
1. Two players take turns marking spaces on the board with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O').
1. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
1. If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

Enjoy the game!
